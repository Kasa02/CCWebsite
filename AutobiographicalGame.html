    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h4>This story is inspired by my own experiences as an international student. Before coming to the United States, I had heard many "stories" that often portray a negative image of this country. However, by living here and experiencing life firsthand, I realized that these preconceptions were just like the rumor in my story: exaggerated and one-sided.
      <br>
      By challenging and breaking down these biases, I found myself embracing a life that is richer, more hopeful, and full of opportunities. Just as the mouse discovered that the cat was not the terrifying predator he feared, I learned that the reality of a place can often be far more nuanced and positive than the tales we hear from afar.
      <br>
      Through the little mouse's journey, Iâ€™ve come to value open-mindedness and the courage to explore the unknown, for it is in these moments that true growth and understanding happen.
      <br>
      (PS: I am also inspired by my cat, who is extremely cute but too fat and lazy to catch mice.)
