    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h4>This optical illusion work could be used for commercial purposes, such as an animated poster on a subway advertisement, which could attract viewers' attention through the effect created by it. Furthermore,  I know there is a kind of fabric called "double-sided sequin fabric," which can be reversible/flipped and create a different color effect. I think my design is kind of like that, so it could possibly be turned into a wearable piece.
