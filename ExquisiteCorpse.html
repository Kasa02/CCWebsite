    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h4>"Mr.Ding is a poor guy who is always unlucky. He really wants to know who stole his fortune away, so he starts his adventure of revenge. He is exhausted and tired from doing so, and the pressure and anxiety have taken his hair away, too. He has a sprit of perseverance: he wonâ€™t stop finding the bad guy until he died. He grown arm muscles after training Thai Boxing, because he wants himself to be stronger enough to beat the bad guy. Ding has become thinner and thinner during the adventure. He was still unfortunate, sadly, and starved every day so his body was not muscular anymore. He also lost his arms when he met a balloon boy called Bobby. Bobby was also taking his revenge. He tried to kill those bulliers and lost all of his sanities. So he accidently cut off Ding's arms. Ding was desperate, but fortunately, a baby octopus just passed by and gave Ding his clothes and scarf as a comfort."</h4>
