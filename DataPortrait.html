    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h4>This is about my frequency of cooking at home. I didn't count the times I ordered food delivery during that week, only focusing on the times I cooked. After collecting the data, I realized that my frequency of cooking is directly associated with my class schedule- if I have too much class during a day (such as Thursday), I would grab some snacks to eat instead of spending time cooking. Even though it is not healthy to eat snakes as a proper meal, the problem of time management is difficult to modify.</h4>
