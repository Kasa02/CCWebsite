    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h4>This is an abstract form of time, based on the idiom in Chinese content. The idiom I got inspiration from is “Dripping water wears through a stone”. I think it is about time, effort, and patience. In this abstract form, the concept of perseverance is well-expressed and people could feel encouraged from observing such a natural phenomenon. It is novel to me because it is quite hard to imagine how long the water drops may take to penetrate a stone. It is pretty personified, because a person who keeps working hard toward the same direction and putting every effort into it, could also finally achieve the target. </h4>
